//! Ergonomic embedding facade and product profile wiring for `tea-rs`.
//!
//! The runtime owns replaceable inward-facing ports (model provider, tool
//! registry, policy engine, session store, clock, ID source, event sink,
//! context providers, and prompt compiler) and exposes an in-process command
//! sender, bounded event subscription, session snapshots, and health
//! inspection. It contains no product prompt, live provider, UI, filesystem,
//! process, network, or database adapter.
//!
//! Core contracts are available through the [`context`], [`control`],
//! [`kernel`], [`model`], [`policy`], [`profile`], [`protocol`], [`session`],
//! and [`tools`] namespaces. Concrete provider, persistence, MCP, native-tool,
//! and product adapters remain separate dependencies selected by the host.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//!
//! use tea::{AgentRuntimeBuilder, RuntimeError, profile::AgentProfile};
//!
//! # async fn _example() -> Result<(), RuntimeError> {
//! let runtime = AgentRuntimeBuilder::new()
//!     .profile(AgentProfile::minimal_assistant()?)
//!     // Wire a model provider, tools, and policy rules before building.
//!     .build()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
